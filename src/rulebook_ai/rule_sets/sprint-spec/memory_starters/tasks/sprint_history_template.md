**Example Prompts for Maintaining Sprint History:**

*   "What were the key achievements and learnings from the completed sprint?"
*   "How did our actual velocity compare to planned velocity, and what factors influenced this?"
*   "What patterns are emerging in our sprint performance over time?"
*   "What process improvements from retrospectives should be tracked and measured?"
*   "What technical debt or architectural decisions from this sprint will impact future work?"
*   "How does our sprint progress align with quarterly and release goals?"
*   "What external factors or dependencies affected sprint performance?"
