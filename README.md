# Rulebook-AI

Rulebook-AI helps you install and sync high-quality rules and a persistent "memory bank" across AI coding assistants (Cursor, Cline, RooCode, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot) via a single CLI.

- Python: 3.9+
- Package: `rulebook-ai` (PyPI)
- CLI entrypoint: `rulebook-ai`
- Source layout: `src/rulebook_ai/`

## Quick Start (uv/uvx)

```bash
# Install uv if needed
curl -fsSL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | bash

# Try the CLI without creating a venv
uvx rulebook-ai list-rules
uvx rulebook-ai install --rule-set light-spec --project-dir /path/to/your/project
uvx rulebook-ai doctor
```

## Quick Start (venv)

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -e .

# CLI usage
rulebook-ai list-rules
rulebook-ai install --rule-set light-spec --project-dir /path/to/your/project
rulebook-ai sync --rule-set light-spec --project-dir /path/to/your/project
rulebook-ai clean-rules --project-dir /path/to/your/project
rulebook-ai doctor
```

## What gets created in your project

- `project_rules/` from selected rule set (e.g., `light-spec`)
- `memory/` initialized from memory starters (non-destructive)
- `tools/` initialized from tool starters (non-destructive)
- `.env.example` to guide API keys and tool config
- Platform-specific outputs (generated; add to your project’s `.gitignore`):
  - `.cursor/rules/`
  - `.windsurf/rules/`
  - `.clinerules/`
  - `.roo/`
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

Tip (Windsurf): after install, activate rules in the GUI (see linked note in this README).

## CLI Commands

- **list-rules**: prints available rule sets.
- **install**: copies rules/memory/tools and generates platform files.
  - Flags: `--rule-set`, `--project-dir`, `--clean`, `--no-copilot`, `--cursor|--windsurf|--cline|--roo|--all-assistants`
- **sync**: regenerates platform files from your current `project_rules/`.
  - Flags: `--rule-set`, `--project-dir`, `--no-copilot`, assistant selectors as above
- **clean-rules**: removes `project_rules/` and generated platform files only.
- **clean-all**: removes everything created by install (rules, memory, tools, env files, generated outputs).
- **doctor**: checks Python version, venv, required packages, and presence of rules and `.env` hints.

Requirements checked by `doctor`: `openai`, `anthropic`, `python-dotenv`, `playwright`, `html5lib`, `duckduckgo-search`.

5.  **Latest Compatibility:** Designed and tested with recent versions of the supported AI assistants.

## Leveraging Your AI's Enhanced Brain: Example Interactions

Once Rulebook-AI is set up with a chosen rule set (in `project_rules/`) and the memory bank (in `memory/`), you can interact with your AI coding assistant much more effectively. Here are a few crucial examples of how to leverage this enhanced context and guidance. Remember to use your AI assistant's specific syntax for referencing files (e.g., `@filename` in Cursor or Copilot).

1.  **Maintain Project Structure & Planning:**
    *   **Goal:** Use the AI to help keep your project documentation and task lists up-to-date.
    *   **Example Prompt (in your AI chat):**
        ```
        Based on section 3.2 of @memory/docs/product_requirement_docs.md, create three new tasks in @memory/tasks/tasks_plan.md for the upcoming 'User Profile Redesign' feature. For each task, include a brief description, assign it a unique ID, and estimate its priority (High/Medium/Low).
        ```
    *   **Why this is important:** This demonstrates the AI actively participating in project management by updating the "memory bank" itself. It ensures your planning documents stay synchronized with insights derived from foundational requirements, turning the AI into a proactive assistant beyond just code generation.
2.  **Retrieve Context-Specific Information Instantly:**
    *   **Goal:** Quickly access key project details without manually searching through documents.
    *   **Example Prompt (in your AI chat):**
        ```
        What is the current status of task 'API-003' as listed in @memory/tasks/tasks_plan.md? Also, remind me which database technology we decided on according to @memory/docs/architecture.md.
        ```
    *   **Why this is important:** This highlights the power of the "persistent memory bank." The AI acts as a knowledgeable team member, capable of quickly recalling specific project decisions, technical details, and task statuses, significantly improving your workflow efficiency.
3.  **Implement Features with Deep Context & Guided Workflow:**
    *   **Goal:** Guide the AI to develop code by following defined procedures and referencing precise project context.
    *   **Example Prompt (in your AI chat):**
        ```
        Using the workflow defined in @project_rules/implement.md, please develop the `updateUserProfile` function. The detailed requirements for this function are specified under the 'User Profile Update' task in @memory/tasks/active_context.md. Ensure the implementation aligns with the API design guidelines found in @memory/docs/technical.md.
        ```
    *   **Why this is important:** This is the core development loop where Rulebook-AI shines. It shows the AI leveraging both the *procedural rules* (how to approach implementation, from `project_rules/\`) and the rich *contextual memory* (what to implement and its surrounding technical landscape, from `memory/\`). This leads to more accurate, consistent, and context-aware code generation, reducing rework and improving quality.

These examples illustrate how providing structured rules and a persistent memory bank allows for more sophisticated and productive interactions with your AI coding assistant. Experiment with referencing different files from your `project_rules/\` and `memory/\` directories to best suit your workflow.

## Quickstart: Using this Template for AI Coding

This template repository serves as the central source for master rule sets. To use these rules in your own projects, you'll utilize the `src/manage_rules.py` script provided within *this* repository.

**Core Concepts:**

*   **Source Template Repo:** This repository, containing master rule sets (in `rule_sets/`), master memory bank starter documents (in `memory_starters/`), master tool starters (in `tool_starters/`), and the `manage_rules.py` script.
*   **Target Repo:** Your project repository (e.g., `~/git/my_cool_project`) where you want to use the rules.
*   **Target Project Rules Directory:** A folder named **`project_rules/`** created *inside your Target Repo* by the `install` command. It holds the specific rule files for *your* project, copied from a chosen set in the Source Template Repo's `rule_sets/` directory. This folder is used by the `sync` command and **removed by the `clean-rules` command**. It is managed by the script, though you can version control it for manual backups if desired.
*   **Target Memory Bank Directory:** A folder named **`memory/`** created *inside your Target Repo* during installation. It's populated with project-specific memory documents from the Source Template Repo's `memory_starters/` (new starter files are copied if they don't exist; existing files are **not** overwritten). **This folder should be version controlled in your Target Repo.**
*   **Target Tools Directory:** A folder named **`tools/`** created *inside your Target Repo* during installation. It's populated with utility scripts or configurations from the Source Template Repo's `tool_starters/` (new starter files/subdirectories are copied if they don't exist; existing files/subdirectories are **not** overwritten). **This folder should be version controlled in your Target Repo.**
*   **Target `env.example` and `requirements.txt`:** The `env.example` and `requirements.txt` files are copied from the Source Template Repo's root to *your Target Repo's root* during installation (non-destructively; existing files are preserved). **These files should be version controlled in your Target Repo.**
*   **Target Platform Rules:** Generated, platform-specific rule directories/files (e.g., `.cursor/rules/`, `.clinerules/`, `.roo/`, `.windsurf/rules/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) created *inside your Target Repo* by the `sync` command using `project_rules/` as input. **These folders/files should be added to your Target Repo's `.gitignore` file.**

**Workflow & Commands:**

*(Run these commands from your terminal, inside your checked-out copy of **this** `rules_template` repository)*

1.  **List Available Rule Sets (Optional):**
    *   Use the `list-rules` command to see which rule sets are available for installation from this Source Template Repo.
    *   **Command:**
        ```bash
        python src/manage_rules.py list-rules
        ```
    *   **Action:** Scans the `rule_sets/` directory in this repository and lists all available rule set names.

2.  **Install Rules and Framework Components into Your Project:**
    *   Use the `install` command to copy a chosen rule set, memory starters, and tool starters from this repo into your target project, and then perform an initial sync.
        * **NOTE** for windsurf user, after install rules, activate rules in GUI (see this [bug fix](https://github.com/botingw/rulebook-ai/issues/13#issuecomment-2911331241))
    *   **Command:**
        ```bash
        # Syntax: python src/manage_rules.py install <path_to_your_target_repo> [--rule-set <rule_set_name>]
        # Example (using default 'light-spec' rule set):
        python src/manage_rules.py install ~/git/my_cool_project
        # Example (specifying a rule set):
        python src/manage_rules.py install ~/git/my_cool_project --rule-set heavy-spec
        ```
    *   **Action:**
        *   Copies the specified rule set (default: `light-spec`) from this repo's `rule_sets/<rule_set_name>/` to `~/git/my_cool_project/project_rules/`. (Overwrites `project_rules/` if it exists, with a warning).
        *   Copies content from this repo's `memory_starters/` to `~/git/my_cool_project/memory/` (non-destructively; existing files are preserved).
        *   Copies content from this repo's `tool_starters/` to `~/git/my_cool_project/tools/` (non-destructively; existing files/subdirectories are preserved).
        *   Copies `env.example` and `requirements.txt` from this repo's root to `~/git/my_cool_project/` (non-destructively; existing files are preserved).
        *   Automatically runs the `sync` command to generate the initial Target Platform Rules (e.g., `.cursor/rules/`, `.clinerules/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) inside `~/git/my_cool_project/` based on the new `project_rules/`.
    *   **Follow Up:**
        *   Add the generated directories/files (e.g., `.cursor/`, `.clinerules/`, `.roo/`, `.windsurf/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) to your target project's (`~/git/my_cool_project/`) `.gitignore`.
        *   Commit the newly created/updated `memory/`, `tools/`, `env.example`, and `requirements.txt` files/directories within your target project.

# Sync (update) rules when rulebook-ai is updated
uvx rulebook-ai sync --rule-set light-spec --project-dir /path/to/your/project

# List available rule sets
uvx rulebook-ai list-rules

# Check your setup with the doctor command
uvx rulebook-ai doctor

# Clean up rules
uvx rulebook-ai clean-rules --project-dir /path/to/your/project
```

### Using a Virtual Environment

For development or more persistent usage:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install rulebook-ai in development mode
uv pip install -e .

# Now use the commands directly
rulebook-ai install --rule-set light-spec --project-dir /path/to/your/project
rulebook-ai sync --rule-set light-spec
rulebook-ai list-rules
```

### Start Coding with AI Assistants

Once rules are installed, use your AI coding assistants (Cursor, CLINE, etc.) in your target project.

**Initial Prompt Suggestion (for setting up memory in a new project):**
> Using the project's custom rules, initialize the Memory Bank files (docs/, tasks/) based on the project's current state or initial requirements. Follow the structure and instructions defined in the rules for documenting project context.

6.  **Clean Up Rules (Preserving Memory & Tools):**
    *   To remove the generated Target Platform Rules and the `project_rules/` directory from your target project, while keeping your customized `memory/` and `tools/` directories intact, use the `clean-rules` command.
    *   **Command:**
        ```bash
        # Syntax: python src/manage_rules.py clean-rules <path_to_your_target_repo>
        # Example:
        python src/manage_rules.py clean-rules ~/git/my_cool_project
        ```
    *   **Action:** Removes `~/git/my_cool_project/project_rules/` and the generated rule directories/files (e.g., `.cursor/`, `.clinerules/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`). The `memory/` and `tools/` directories are **not** affected.

7.  **Clean Up All Framework Components (Full Uninstall):**
    *   To completely remove *all* framework components (Target Platform Rules, `project_rules/`, `memory/`, `tools/`, `env.example`, and `requirements.txt`) from your target project, use the `clean-all` command.
    *   **Important:** This command will prompt for confirmation because it removes `memory/`, `tools/`, `env.example`, and `requirements.txt`, which may contain your project-specific customizations.
    *   **Command:**
        ```bash
        # Syntax: python src/manage_rules.py clean-all <path_to_your_target_repo>
        # Example:
        python src/manage_rules.py clean-all ~/git/my_cool_project
        ```
    *   **Action:** After confirmation, removes `project_rules/`, `memory/`, `tools/`, `env.example`, `requirements.txt`, and all generated rule directories/files from `~/git/my_cool_project/`.

### Environment Setup (Using Conda)

Before running the tools described in the rules, set up the Conda environment:

1.  **Create the environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create -n rules_template python=3.11 -y 
    ```
    *(Ensure you have Conda installed. We recommend Python 3.11, but adjust if needed.)*

2.  **Activate the environment:**
    ```bash
    conda activate rules_template
    ```
    *(You'll need to activate this environment in any terminal session where you intend to run the tools.)*

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Install playwright:**
    ```bash
    playwright install
    ```
5.  **Configure your environment:**
    ```bash
    - Setup your API keys in `.env` (optional, check out rules_template/light-spec/01-rules/06-rules_v1.md for API tool context) 

With the environment set up and activated, you can run the Python tools as described in the rules files (e.g., `python tools/llm_api.py ...`).

# The Rules Template: Universal Rules for AI Coding Assistants 🔥 

This template provides a robust and adaptable framework of rules designed to enhance the performance of AI coding assistants like Cursor and CLINE. Rooted in established software engineering principles and documentation best practices, it ensures consistent and effective AI-assisted development across different platforms.

For detail, go to [rule_template.md](memory/docs/user_guide/rule_template.md)

# Rule Files:

This template relies on a carefully orchestrated system of directories and files for Cursor, Windsurf, Github Copilot, CLINE and RooCode. These components work together to provide a consistent and context-aware experience with your AI assistant. The **'rule' files** (e.g., `plan.md`, `implement.md`, `debug.md` found within a chosen rule set like `light-spec/`) are designed to define *how your AI should approach tasks*. They dictate specific workflows for planning, coding, or debugging, rooted in software engineering best practices. These rules guide the AI's *process* and operational methodology. The **'memory' files** and the `memory/\` directory structure (populated from `memory_starters/\` during installation) are designed to provide the AI with *persistent, structured knowledge about your specific project*. This includes its requirements (@`memory/docs/product_requirement_docs.md`), architecture (@`memory/docs/architecture.md`), ongoing tasks (@`memory/tasks/tasks_plan.md`), and learned information. This forms the AI's *contextual understanding* and long-term project "memory." Within each environment, there are crucial files that shape how the AI operates:

1. <strong>rules</strong> –
   Thois can house generic rules. Bring your own flavour to this minimal document. Below are three files: (a) plan, (b) implement, (c) debug, that defines workflows for these three tasks based on refining 100s of rule repositories and software engineering best practices:

2. <strong>plan</strong> – Defines the Workflow to be followed for any Planning based on *chain of thinking*. includes **exhaustive searching and optimal plan, rigourous reasoning and user validation**.
3. <strong>implement</strong> - Defines the Workflow to be followed for any Implementation. inspired by concepts like **seperation of concerns, modular design, and incremental development**. Has testing mandatory after every significant implementation.
4. <strong>debug</strong> - This file defines rules for debugging when stuck in a loop or a hard debugging. Supports looking at the web and for previously solved errors too.
5. <strong>memory</strong> –
   Next comes the recommended documentation. Software documentation starts with PRDs Recording the requirements, architecture plan, technical plan, and the RFCs for individual functionality or group of functionalities.
So our documentation that also served as a context is very relevant for an AI cod as it has mostly the knowledge and the skills to work on and with these proper software documentations.
6. <strong>directory-structure</strong> (directory-structure) –
   This is a very simple file stating the directory structure so that all parts of a project development is covered like : (a) code, (b) test, (c) configurations, (d) data, (e) project rules, etc separately and in modular approach.

In <strong>Cursor </strong>, these three files reside in <code>.cursor/rules</code>:

```bash
.cursor/rules/rules.mdc
.cursor/rules/plan.mdc
.cursor/rules/implement.mdc
.cursor/rules/debug.mdc
.cursor/rules/memory.mdc
.cursor/rules/directory-structure.mdc
```
In **CLINE**, this template uses the `clinerules/` directory for files intended for AI guidance (via `.clinerules`) or manual copy-paste into UI settings:
```bash
clinerules/
├── plan
├── implement
└── debug
# Plus the .clinerules file at the root for general project rules & AI mode guidance.
```
For **RooCode**, the *correct* structure (which this template needs to adopt - See To-Do #1) would be:
```bash
.roo/
├── rules/              # Workspace-wide rules (e.g., memory, dir-structure)
│   └── ...
├── rules-architect/    # Mode-specific rules (e.g., plan)
│   └── ...
├── rules-code/         # Mode-specific rules (e.g., implement)
│   └── ...
└── rules-debug/        # Mode-specific rules (e.g., debug)
    └── ...
```
For **Windsurf**, rules are generated in the `.windsurf/rules/` directory, with each rule as a separate `.md` file.
```bash
.windsurf/rules/
├── 01-example-rule.md
└── 02-another-rule.md
```

## Key Files and Concepts

This template is organized around three core files, each addressing a critical aspect of the development process:

### 1. Plan/Implement/Debug: Systematic Workflow for Tasks

The `rules` files (located in `clinerules/rules` and `cursor/rules/rules.mdc`) define a structured, five-phased workflow for approaching any development task, regardless of granularity. This workflow is based on standard software engineering best practices and promotes a systematic approach to problem-solving.

**Five-Phased Workflow:**

**(i) Requirements and Clarifications:**

   it starts with making the requirements very clear and asking as much clarification as possible in the beginning. This is always the first task software development. Where all the requirements are made as precise and verbose as possible so as to save Time and effort later in redoing. Plus anticipate Major bottlenecks ahead of any work.

**(ii) Exhaustive Searching and Optimal Plan:**
  exhaustive searching and optimal plan: search all possible directions in which the problem can be solved. And find out the optimal solution, which can be also a amalgamation of many different approaches. And reason rigourously, why the chosen approach is optimal.

**(iii) User Validation:**

  validate the developed optimal plan with the user clearly stating the assumptions and design decisions made, and the reasons for them.

**(iv) Implementation:**

   implement proposed plan in an iterative way, taking one functionality at a time, testing it exhaustively with all the cases. And then building the next functionality. In this way to make the system, robust and incremental.

**(v) Further Suggestions:**

   after implementation, suggesting possible optimisation to be done or possible, additional features for security or functionality to be added.

So this five phased approach, is for a software life-cycle. But this can be applied for any grnuarlity, like entire project or a single functionality. For example, very clearly recording the requirement for the functionality and asking clarifying questions is as good for a single small functionality as for a program.
So this five phased, solution strategy workflow is to be followed at every part of development.

### 2. Memory: Persistent Project Documentation

The `memory` files (located in `clinerules/memory` and `cursor/rules/memory.mdc`) establish a robust documentation system that serves as persistent memory for the project and the AI assistant. This system is inspired by standard software development documentation practices, including PRDs, architecture plans, technical specifications, and RFCs. So, keeping these software life-cycle documentation is as focus. We develop our memory bank to have these document in sync to provide the complete context for the project. We have few additional files for current context and task plan in tasks/.

**Memory Files Structure:**

The memory system is structured into Core Files (required) and Context Files (optional), forming a hierarchical knowledge base for the project.

    - Stores RFCs for individual tasks in LaTeX format (`tasks/rfc/*.tex`), providing detailed specifications and discussions for specific functionalities.

**Additional Context:**

Further files and folders can be added within `docs/` or `tasks/` to organize supplementary documentation such as integration specifications, testing strategies, and deployment procedures.

### 3. Directory Structure: Modular Project Organization

The `directory-structure` files (located in `clinerules/directory-structure` and `cursor/rules/directory-structure.mdc`) define a clear and modular directory structure to organize project files logically. This structure promotes separation of concerns and enhances project maintainability. This is a very simple file stating the directory structure so that all parts of a project development is covered like : (a) code, (b) test, (c) configurations, (d) data, e.g. project rules, etc separately and in modular approach.

**Directory Structure Diagram:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Root[Project Root]
    Root --> Docs[docs/]
    Root --> Tasks[tasks/]
    Root --> Cursor[.cursor/rules/]
    Root --> CLINE[.clinerules]
    Root --> SourceCode[src/]
    Root --> Test[test/]
    Root --> Utils[utils/]
    Root --> Config[config/]
    Root --> Data[data/]
    Root --> Other[Other Directories]
```

This structure ensures that different aspects of the project, such as code, tests, configurations, and documentation, are kept separate and well-organized.

By adhering to the principles and structure outlined in this Rules Template, development teams can leverage AI coding assistants more effectively, ensuring consistency, quality, and maintainability across their projects.

## Additional Notes:

1. **Product Requirements Documents (PRDs):** PRDs serve multiple purposes: defining product scope and goals, aligning stakeholders across teams, and mitigating risks early in development. They offer significant utility by providing clarity on product vision, prioritizing features, ensuring quality, and enabling traceability throughout the development lifecycle . While traditionally detailed in Waterfall, PRDs are adapted for Agile methodologies as leaner, iterative documents. Related documents include Market Requirements Documents (MRDs) and Functional Requirements Documents (FRDs).
2. **Architecture Documentation:** It serves to preserve design rationale, support scalability, and facilitate decision-making. Key benefits include improved knowledge sharing, risk mitigation, and stakeholder communication. Types of architecture documentation vary, including decision-centric ADRs, structural C4 model diagrams, and behavioral sequence diagrams. Frameworks like arc42 provide structured templates for comprehensive architecture documentation.
3. **Technical Specifications:** Technical Specifications Documents (TSDs) serve as blueprints translating business needs into technical guidelines. They clarify project vision, bridge stakeholder communication, and mitigate risks. TSDs are highly useful for engineers as step-by-step guides, for teams as alignment tools, and for projects in ensuring accountability. Technical documentation broadly includes process documentation (user manuals, API docs), and specialized specs for IT or Agile projects. A robust TSD enhances project clarity and reduces failure risks associated with unclear requirements.
4. **RFCs (Request for Comments):** Request for Comments (RFCs) are structured proposals for technical decision-making and standardization. They document technical specifications, solicit feedback, and preserve institutional knowledge. RFCs enhance utility by reducing silos, mitigating risks, and ensuring decision traceability. Types range from standards-track protocol specifications to organizational RFCs for team-specific designs. Modern RFCs often include problem statements, proposed solutions, alternatives, rollout plans, and security impact assessments. While RFCs improve decision quality, they also pose challenges like time overhead and consensus bottlenecks.
